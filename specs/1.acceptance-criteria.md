# Acceptance Criteria (EARS Format)

This document outlines the acceptance criteria for the `ps-mem` utility using the Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax (EARS).

## Ubiquitous Requirements

*   **UC1**: The `ps-mem` system shall list the PID, RSS, Swap, Total memory, and command for running processes.
*   **UC2**: The `ps-mem` system shall display all memory sizes in KiB.
*   **UC3**: The `ps-mem` system shall provide a summary row showing the total memory consumed.

## Event-Driven Requirements

*   **ED1**: When a user runs `ps-mem` with a specific command, the system shall execute that command and monitor its memory usage until termination.
*   **ED2**: When a user provides the `--pid` option with a process ID, the system shall display memory usage for only that specified process.
*   **ED3**: When a user provides the `-a` or `--all` flag, the system shall include all processes, including kernel threads, in the output.
*   **ED4**: When a user provides the `--sort` option with a valid order (rss, swap, or total), the system shall sort the process list based on that metric.
*   **ED5**: When a user provides the `-l` or `--cmdline` flag, the system shall display the full command line for each process.
*   **ED6**: When a user provides the `-H` or `--help` flag, the system shall display the help message and exit.
*   **ED7**: When a user provides the `-V` or `--version` flag, the system shall display the version information and exit.
*   **ED8**: When a user provides the `-X` flag with a valid parameter, the system shall handle the specified advanced option.
